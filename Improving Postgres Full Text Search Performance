I have been experimenting with the tool and i still find search perforemacne to be quite slow. What are some methods to improve performance?

## Assistant

Search slowness in **2brain** usually comes from a mix of (a) slow PostgreSQL text ranking, (b) expensive joins/filters (especially `embedding_status`), (c) missing/ineffective indexes, and (d) returning too much data per query. Here are the highest‑leverage methods, in roughly the order I’d try them.

## 1) Make sure your FTS/BM25 path is actually index-backed
If you’re using Postgres full-text search (FTS), you want:

- a **stored `tsvector` column** (or generated column) for the segment text
- a **GIN index** on that `tsvector`
- a query that uses `@@` against the `tsvector` (not building vectors on the fly)

If your query does `to_tsvector(...)` inside the `WHERE`, Postgres often can’t use the index efficiently.

**Check** with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` on your slow search query and verify you see a `Bitmap Index Scan` (GIN) rather than a sequential scan.

## 2) Reduce ranking cost: “filter first, rank later”
`ts_rank` over a large candidate set is expensive. Pattern to speed up:

1. Use `@@` to get candidate rows quickly (index-backed)
2. Add selective filters early (workspace/user, time, document_id, etc.)
3. Only then compute rank and sort on a smaller set

A common trick is a 2-stage query: first fetch candidate IDs (limit ~2000), then compute ranks + joins + full projection only for those.

## 3) Add the *right* supporting indexes for your filters
Even if FTS is indexed, your extra filters can force heavy work if they aren’t indexed well. Typical ones in this app:

- `document_segments(document_id)` (btree)
- `document_segments(conversation_id)` / `source_id` etc. (btree)
- `document_segments(embedding_status)` (btree) if you filter on it a lot
- Composite indexes that match your most common filter patterns, e.g.  
  `(workspace_id, document_id)` or `(workspace_id, embedding_status)` depending on your schema.

Also make sure your join keys are indexed on both sides (e.g. `documents(id)` obviously, but also FK columns).

## 4) Don’t block keyword search on embeddings
From your context: segments with `embedding_status='pending'` are excluded from search. That can accidentally make Postgres do more work (and it hurts UX).

Best practice:
- For **keyword/FTS search**, include pending segments (text is available immediately).
- For **vector/hybrid search**, require `embedding_status='ready'`.

This not only improves UX, it often simplifies the FTS query and makes it more selective in the right way.

## 5) Return less data (projection + pagination)
Search endpoints often become slow because they:
- return full segment text + metadata + big JSON blobs
- do heavy joins before limiting

Return only what the results list needs:
- `segment_id`, `document_id`, `score`, maybe a short snippet
- fetch full content only when the user opens a result

Also ensure you have strict `LIMIT/OFFSET` (or keyset pagination) applied *before* big joins when possible.

## 6) Tune Postgres and keep stats fresh
Even perfect indexes can underperform if:
- autovacuum/analyze is behind
- work_mem is too low for sorts
- random_page_cost is too high for SSD environments

What helps most in practice:
- Run `ANALYZE` after large ingests (or ensure autovacuum/analyze is keeping up)
- Increase `work_mem` modestly for the search role/session if sorts spill to disk
- Watch for “Sort Method: external merge Disk:” in `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`

## 7) If you do hybrid search, do it in two phases
Vector search + FTS + ranking in one SQL query can be expensive.

Faster approach:
- Run vector search to get top K segment IDs (e.g. 200–1000)
- Run FTS/ranking (or just metadata fetch + rerank in Python) against that smaller set
- Or do the reverse: FTS first for recall, then vector rerank

## 8) Cache the hot path
Even a simple cache can massively reduce perceived latency:
- Cache query → result IDs for a short TTL (10–60s) per user/workspace
- Cache document metadata and segment snippets
- If you have “typeahead” search, debounce on the client and cache server-side by normalized query string

---

### The fastest way to get you to “what’s actually slow”
If you paste the **exact slow query** (or tell me which endpoint, like `GET /search`), I can tell you precisely what to index / rewrite. Even better: run `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` for one slow query and share the output—then I’ll point at the line that’s dominating runtime and propose a targeted fix.

## Assistant

## What the plan is telling you (the root cause)

Your “hybrid” query is slow because **both sides are doing full table scans + sorts**:

- **BM25/FTS side**: `Seq Scan` on `document_segments ds_1` then `Sort` by `ts_rank(...)` over ~11,810 rows.
  - That means Postgres is **not using a GIN tsvector index** for the text match. In fact, in the plan it’s not even filtering by `@@ tsquery`; it’s scanning everything that matches `(NOT is_noise) AND embedding_status='ready'` and computing rank for all of them.
- **Vector side**: `Seq Scan` on `document_segments ds_2` then `Sort` by `(embedding <=> query_vec)` over ~6,191 rows.
  - That means Postgres is **not using a pgvector index** (IVFFLAT/HNSW). It’s computing distance for all rows and sorting.

Those two seq-scans/sorts dominate runtime. The rest (PK lookups into `document_versions`, `documents`) is fine.

## Highest-impact fixes

### 1) Fix the FTS query so it can use a GIN index (and actually filter)
Right now you’re doing something like:

- compute `ts_rank(ds.content_plaintext, tsquery)` but **not** `WHERE ds.content_plaintext @@ tsquery`

You want the FTS leg to look like:

- `WHERE ds.content_plaintext @@ q`
- order by `ts_rank(ds.content_plaintext, q)` (or `ts_rank_cd`)
- `LIMIT k`

And you want a **GIN index** on `content_plaintext` (tsvector), ideally partial to match your filters:

- partial index where `(NOT is_noise) AND embedding_status='ready'` **if you must keep that filter**

Even better: for keyword search you probably *shouldn’t* require `embedding_status='ready'`—that’s a self-inflicted reduction in recall and it also makes your partial-index logic awkward. Keep `NOT is_noise` though.

### 2) Add a pgvector ANN index and structure the vector query to use it
For the vector leg you want:

- a query shaped like `ORDER BY embedding <=> query_vec LIMIT k`
- with an ANN index on `embedding`:
  - **HNSW** (best latency/recall; available in newer pgvector)
  - or **IVFFLAT** (requires `ANALYZE`; needs `lists` tuning)

Also consider making it a **partial index** matching your filter:

- `WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL AND NOT is_noise AND embedding_status='ready'`

Your plan shows you filter that way already; the index must match.

### 3) Don’t compute expensive per-document aggregates inside the search query
This part is also potentially expensive at scale:

- the `Aggregate` over `ds_all` to compute `count(*)` and `sum(length(content_markdown))` for each returned row (per document version)

It’s currently using an index (`document_version_id_idx`), so it might be “ok now”, but it will grow linearly with result count and segment counts.

Better options:
- **precompute** these stats on `document_versions` (segment_count, total_chars) during ingestion
- or fetch them in a second query only for the 20 returned docs

### 4) Two-phase “candidate then join” pattern
You’re already close to this with the `Append` of BM25 + vector candidates, but you still pay the heavy scan/sort cost in each subquery.

After you fix indexing, also make sure:
- both legs return only `(segment_id, score)` (no big text)
- then join to fetch `left(content_markdown, 280)` and document metadata for the top N

## Concrete next step (what I need from you)
To give you exact SQL + index DDL that matches your schema, I need to see how you store FTS and vector:

- Is `document_segments.content_plaintext` a `tsvector` column? (plan suggests yes)
- What pgvector index (if any) exists on `document_segments.embedding`?

If you want, I can inspect the code in your repo and propose a patch. Tell me whether the backend code lives under `2brain/app` (FastAPI) and I’ll locate the `/search` implementation and the migration that creates indexes, then provide targeted edits.
